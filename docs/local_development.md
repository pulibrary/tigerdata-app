# Local Development with MediaFlux

Instructions to download MediaFlux as a Docker container and run it locally.

## Prerequisites

* Docker: Make sure Docker is installed and running locally.


## If you have a previous Docker image

Stop the current Docker container and remove both the container and the image used to create it:

```
docker stop mediaflux
docker rm mediaflux
docker rmi princeton_dev:latest  (or the version you had previously like mediaflux_dev:latest )
```

You can use `docker images` to find out the exact name of the image to delete.


## Load the new Docker image

1. Log in to docker # See [Ansible Vault](https://github.com/pulibrary/princeton_ansible/blob/main/group_vars/mflux/vault.yml) for docker hub username and password, or check lastpass under "RDSS Docker"

```
export DOCKERHUB_USERNAME="username here"
export DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD="password here"
echo "$DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD" | docker login --username $DOCKERHUB_USERNAME --password-stdin
```

2. _create a container_ with an image from docker hub (notice we name it `mediaflux`)

```
docker create --name mediaflux --platform linux/amd64 --mac-address 02:42:ac:11:00:02 --publish 8888:80 pulibraryrdss/mediaflux_dev:latest
```

3. From now on when you need _start this container_ you can use:

```
docker start mediaflux
```

4. Once the container is running you can access it at the default endpoints:

  * The Desktop client - http://0.0.0.0:8888/desktop/
  * The Aterm client in the browser - http://0.0.0.0:8888/aterm/
  * Service documentation - http://0.0.0.0:8888/mflux/service-docs
  * The thick client for aterm (see instructions below)


5. You can stop the container in the Docker dashboard or via

```
docker stop mediaflux
```

and restart it via and it will preserve your changes (e.g. the assets that you added)

```
docker start mediaflux
```

## Initializing the new Mediaflux

Remember that this is a brand new Mediaflux and therefore you'll need to recreate the schema

```
bundle exec rake schema:create
```

and re-exectute the Aterm command so that the Desktop shows collections properly:

```
actor.grant :type user :name system:manager :role -type role desktop-experimental
```

and recreate any collections and namespaces that you need.


## SSHing into the container

Once the container is running we can SSH into it, this is useful to look at the logs of the running MediaFlux server:

```
docker exec -it mediaflux /bin/bash
root@12345:/setup#
```

The logs are found under the `/usr/local/mediaflux/volatile/logs` folder.

If for some reason you need to _manually_ launch MediaFlux server you can use a command as follows:

```
root@12345:/setup# /usr/bin/env java -jar /usr/local/mediaflux/bin/aserver.jar application.home=/usr/local/mediaflux nogui
```

## Accessing the thick client (Aterm)

1. Get a copy of `aterm.jar` to run locally.  While the container is running run the following cURL command to download it:

```
curl -OL http://0.0.0.0:8888/mflux/aterm.jar
```

2. Run it

```
java -jar aterm.jar
```

3. At the login screen, change "server" to `0.0.0.0` and "port" to `8888`.  Use the default domain, user, and password information.

See [Aterm for beginners](aterm_101.md) for more information on Aterm.

## Test Projects and Assets

There are a few ways to generate test projects and test assets.  The simplest is to run the rake task `projects:create_small_project`.  For example `rake projects:create_small_project\[cac9,mytest]` will create a project for the user `cac9` under the prefix mytest and create a random amount of assets underneath.

You can also utilize the TestAssetGenerator in the rails console to add assets to an existing project.  For example the following script grabs the first User in the system and the last Project in the system.  It then saves the project to mediaflux and then generates a hierarchy of assets under the project.

```
rails c
  user = User.first
  project = Project.last
  project.save_in_mediaflux(session_id: user.mediaflux_session)
  gen = TestAssetGenerator.new(project_id: project.id,user:, levels: 2, directory_per_level: 2,file_count_per_directory: 20)
  gen.generate
```

You can also utilize `Mediaflux::TestAssetCreateRequest` to generate some assets in an existing collection under a project

```
rails c
  parent_id = 1234 # collection id from mediaflux
  gen = Mediaflux::TestAssetCreateRequest.new(session_token: User.first.mediaflux_session, parent_id:, count: 5, pattern: "test_asset_" )
  gen.resolve
```
