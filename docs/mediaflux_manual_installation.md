# Mediaflux manual installation
Notes from first attempt at manual mediaflux installation by Francis Kayiwa, Robert-Anthony Lee-Faison, and Bess Sadler

### 1. Add the box to active directory
Ask Francis or Alicia how to do this.
We had to re-name the machines to mflux-staging and mflux-ci to make the names short enough to fit into active directory (string length limit)

Note that our systems occasionally lose their bind to AD, and this is a known issue. Francis is working on a solution. The workaround right now is to go to AD, delete the object, re-add it, and re-run the ansible playbook.

### 2. We re-created the boxes to run on rocky linux
We have systemd files from research computing that configure mflux on Red Hat Enterprise. We believe that building this on rocky linux 9 should give us the ability to use these files.
Note that when we re-build these boxes we need to keep the mac address the same, otherwise the license keys won't work.

Steps to install on mflux-staging

`dnf search java | grep 1.8`
`sudo dnf install java-1.8.0-openjdk`

### 3. Francis registered a lib-mflux service acccount
This will be used to bind Mediaflux servers to active directory.

Server names:
* mflux-staging
* mflux-ci

### 4. Install Java
Per notes from Robert Knight, Mediaflux production is running Java 1.8.0.412.b08, release 2.el8.

`sudo dnf install java-1.8.0-openjdk`

### 4. get the installer
```unix
$ sudo dnf install wget
$ wget https://www.arcitecta.com/software/mf/4.16.082/mflux-dev_4.16.082_jvm_1.8.jar
$ sudo java -jar mflux-dev_jvm_1.8.jar nogui
-> accept
-> /opt/mediaflux
$ sudo cp licence-staging.xml /opt/mediaflux/config/licence.xml
$ sudo dnf copr enable tkbcopr/fd
$ sudo dnf install fd
```

We used default config for the  database.

  In /opt/mediaflux/config/services/network.tcl
  Make sure this line is uncommented:
  network.start :type http :port 80 :maxc 100


We copied Robert K's systemd file to /etc/systemd/system/mediaflux.service

Francis added a user and a group called mediaflux

```
$ sudo useradd -r mediaflux

```

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl status mediaflux
sudo systemctl enable mediaflux
sudo systemctl start mediaflux
```

Next: open port 80
Seems to be running, but can't reach it.
