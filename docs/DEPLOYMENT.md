# Deploying TigerData

## Capistrano

Currently TigerData uses the [Capistrano](https://rubygems.org/gems/capistrano) Ruby Gem in order to automate the deployment of the application into server environments. While normally this process is automated using `Ansible Tower`, one may deploy the application manually by invoking the following:

```bash
$ bundle exec cap staging deploy
```

## Ansible Tower

The preferred approach for deploying `TigerData` is the usage of the Princeton University Library [Ansible Tower](https://ansible-tower.princeton.edu/) instance in order to request a new deployment of the application into a specific environment. In order to deploy the application, please find the following steps:

![Within the Ansible Tower dashboard, please select the "Templates" menu, followed by the "Capistrano deploy" template](./images/tiger_data_app_deploy0.png "Within the Ansible Tower dashboard, please select the Templates menu, followed by the Capistrano deploy template")
![Within the modal dialogue, please then select the "tigerdata-app" repository, along with the desired branch and environment for production](./images/tiger_data_app_deploy1.png "Please select the tigerdata-app repository, along with the desired branch and environment for production")
![Then please select the "Launch" button](./images/tiger_data_app_deploy2.png "Then please select the Launch button")

For more guidance and information regarding the deployment of RDSS applications using Tower, please refer to [the "Deployment" section of the PUL IT Handbook](https://github.com/pulibrary/pul-it-handbook/blob/main/services/deployment.md).
